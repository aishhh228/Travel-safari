    <p>Turkish Airlines made a big splash yesterday with its Super Bowl commercial starring Dr. Oz (last year they featured Morgan Freeman), and many viewers may have been surprised to see the airline spending such big bucks to up its visibility. But then again, many travelers would be surprised to learn that Turkish Airlines flies to far more international destinations than any other carrier on earth - from a dozen different North American cities. And it does an excellent job of getting them there.

Bottom line: Turkish Airlines has one of the best Business Class products in the world, is also excellent in economy, flies just about everywhere, offers several unique amenities that other airlines don’t have, and does it all at bargain prices while participating in the biggest and best global alliance. That’s a combination that is really hard to beat.

I first flew Turkish to Istanbul and Venice nearly twenty years ago, and I recently flew them again on a long-haul flight from the U.S. to Nairobi, via Istanbul in both directions. In the interim, the airline has improved dramatically, becoming one of the world’s top carriers, and I’m hardly the only one who thinks so: after years of massive capital investment, upgrades and expansion, Turkish has been awash in industry awards and critical accolades. If you are not a customer, it’s very likely the best airline you don’t know much about, and certainly the biggest..</p>
